# Sotolf's dotfiles

I'll be trying to make my dotfiles available here so that 
I have my configs available, and also as a hope that I do 
make an attempt at actually making them less of a mess.

I am managing them with [dotbare](https://github.com/kazhala/dotbare)
and I have also based many of them of of [distrotube's configurations](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles)
and then done changes to them to make them work better for me.
